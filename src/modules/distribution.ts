 * This module is in charge of distributing collected transaction fee and inflated token to all validators and delegators.
 * To reduce computation stress, a lazy distribution strategy is brought in. lazy means that the benefit won't be paid directly to contributors automatically.
 * The contributors are required to explicitly send transactions to withdraw their benefit, otherwise, their benefit will be kept in the global pool.
